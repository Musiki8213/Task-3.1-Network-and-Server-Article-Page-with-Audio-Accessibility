# Networked Article Page with Audio Accessibility — Task 3.1
An educational webpage about networking concepts, built with HTML and CSS. Includes an audio version of the article and is shareable across a local network for collaborative learning.

## Project Files
- `networks-and-servers.html` — Main article  
- `style.css` — Page styling  
- `networks-and-servers.mp3` — Audio version of the article  
- `plan-networks.docx/pdf` — Planning document

## Key Features
- Covers Wi-Fi USB dongles, server networks, secure collaboration, and networking types  
- Semantic HTML structure (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)  
- Embedded audio using `<audio>` tag  
- Network-ready: Live Server link shareable via IP  
- Audio file accessible via a shared folder

## How to Use
1. Open `networks-and-servers.html` in a browser.  
2. Play the embedded audio.  
3. Share your Live Server link (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:5500/networks-and-servers.html`) with teammates.  
4. Ensure the audio file is in a shared folder with permissions for access.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand LAN/WAN connections, hotspots, and Wi-Fi dongles  
- Record and embed audio for accessibility  
- Share files and folders across a network  
- Strengthen semantic HTML, layout, and styling skills
